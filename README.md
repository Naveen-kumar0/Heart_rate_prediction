# Heart_rate_prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart rates based on certain features. The prediction model utilizes a machine learning algorithm trained on a dataset of heart rate observations.

## Features
- Heart rate prediction based on input features.
- Simple command-line interface for making predictions.

## Getting Started
To get started with the heart rate prediction model, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

##Model Details
The heart rate prediction model is built using a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features.
